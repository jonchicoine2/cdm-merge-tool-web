## Active Tasks

### ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS: HCPCS Modifier Validation Enhancement
**Status**: Handling API quota limits
**Started**: Current session
**Priority**: High

**Progress**:
- âœ… Updated validation prompt to check modifiers
- âœ… Fixed response parsing for modifier validation
- âœ… Integrated with frontend to show modifier-specific errors
- âœ… Switched from batch to individual validation for accuracy
- âœ… Implemented parallel processing (originally 60 concurrent)
- âœ… Added real-time progress tracking via SSE
- âœ… Updated to Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- âœ… Fixed sliding window implementation bugs
- âœ… Added retry logic for API quota errors
- âœ… Reduced batch size to 10 to avoid rate limits
- âœ… Added delays between batches
- âœ… Added quota warning handling

**Current Issues**:
- Google Gemini API quota exceeded (429 errors)
- Only detecting 1 invalid code instead of expected 3 due to quota issues
- Need to implement better rate limiting

**Next Steps**:
1. Monitor API usage to avoid quota limits
2. Consider implementing local validation for common invalid patterns
3. Add UI notification for quota warnings
4. Test with smaller datasets to verify functionality

### ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED: Restore Last Session Functionality
**Status**: Completed
**Started**: Current session
**Completed**: Current session
**Priority**: High
**Complexity Level**: 1 (Quick Bug Fix)

**Progress**:
- âœ… Identified potential bug in binary data storage in localStorage
- âœ… Implemented base64 encoding for proper storage and restoration of file data
- âœ… Updated handling in handleFileUpload, processAllSheets, and restoreFileData

**Verification**:
- Confirmed binary data is preserved through base64 conversion
- Tested restoration process
