## Task: Publish to GitHub

- **Status:** DONE
- **Goal:** Publish the existing local repository to a new repository on GitHub.
- **Outcome:** The repository was successfully pushed to `https://github.com/jonchicoine2/cdm-merge-tool-web.git`. The initial push failed due to a 403 permission error, which was resolved by the user re-authenticating with GitHub, likely via a browser-based flow.

## Task: HCPCS Modifier Validation Enhancement

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Goal:** Enhance the batch HCPCS validation to include modifier validation, not just base code validation.
- **Problem Identified:** The existing validation endpoint only checked base codes and ignored modifiers, leading to incomplete validation.
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - Updated validation prompt in `src/app/api/validate-hcpcs/route.ts` to explicitly validate both base codes and modifiers
  - Enhanced response parsing to handle structured results with `baseCptValid`, `modifierPresent`, and `modifierValid` fields
  - Improved double-check verification to separately validate base codes and modifiers
  - Enhanced frontend display with type-specific validation indicators (B for base issues, M for modifier issues)
  - Added comprehensive logging and categorization of validation issues
  - Updated documentation with validation examples and feature descriptions
- **Testing:** Verified with test cases including valid codes (99213-25, A1234RT) and invalid codes (99999-ZZ, INVALID-XX)
- **Outcome:** The system now provides comprehensive HCPCS validation that catches both base code and modifier issues, with clear visual feedback and detailed reporting.

## Task: Restore Last Session Functionality Bug Fix

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Goal:** Fix the restore last session feature that was no longer working properly due to incorrect handling of binary file data in localStorage.
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - Identified issue with casting ArrayBuffer to string causing data corruption.
  - Implemented base64 encoding to properly store and restore binary Excel file data.
  - Updated handleFileUpload to convert ArrayBuffer to base64 for storage.
  - Modified processAllSheets and restoreFileData to handle base64 input correctly.
- **Testing:** Verified restoration works with sample data, confirmed binary preservation.
- **Outcome:** Session restoration now functions correctly, preserving full file data across sessions.
